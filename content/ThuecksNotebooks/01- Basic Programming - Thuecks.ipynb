    "* As you follow along with the notes for the course, you will most often use the program 'Spyder', accessed through Anaconda Navigator.\n",

    "## Variables and Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a list of instructions, or *statements* which the computer *executes* in the order they appear in the program. Each statement represents some task (e.g. arithmetic) to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the simplest example.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try entering the following into Spyder:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 1\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    ">>> x = 2\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an *assignment statement*. One of the most important things for you to understand at this point is that `=` has a different meaning in programming than it does in standard mathematics. In Python (and most programming languages), the equals sign is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "### There are *rules* and *guidelines* for naming variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names are *alphanumeric* (letters and numbers) and can include an underscore: `mean_height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names cannot *start* with a number.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a number of *reserved keywords* that should not be used as variable names (you will temporarily overwrite them and be unable to use them).\n",
    "\n",
    "    + These include words like `and, def, for, if` etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + These are rather specific words you are unlikely to choose as variable names, but it is important to keep in mind!\n",
    "        \n",
    "* Try to use variable names that are meaningful and brief (e.g. `trial_nmbr` vs. `the_trial_number`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid variable names that are easily confused, like \"I\" (1?) and \"O\" (0?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `i, j,` and `k` are usually used as integer counters and shouldn't be used for other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generally, use lowercase variables and underscores rather than uppercase letters (`terminal_velocity` vs. `TerminalVelocity`)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lengthy \"style guide\" for Python called PEP8, which is intended to make it easy for people to read Python code written by others. We'll introduce good habits as we go along.  \n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python numbers are *integers*, *floats*, or *complex*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers are specified with no decimal point (e.g. `3`) \n",
    "\n",
    "* Floats are specified with a decimal or with scientific notation (e.g. `3.0` or `3.4E-2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex numbers are specified with the format **`<real> + <imag>j`** or with the **`complex(<real>,<imaginary>)`** command (e.g. `3+4j` or `complex(3,4)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can check a number's type with the **`type()`** command:"
